# Professional README Generator

## Description 

The Professional README Generator is a tool that you can use to save time on styling a README.md page. Focus more on what your program's code and quit worrying so much about making a README page, just follow the prompts. When you're finished, a brand new README.md file will appear with all your information in the distribution folder (./dist).

## Table of Contents (Optional)

To install, simply clone the app and git init the json packages. Once on node, you run the index.js on your terminal and the program will guide you through some prompts. When you're finished, a brand new README.md file will appear with all your information in the distribution folder (./dist).

## Usage 

Follow the prompts and answer each question thoroughly. When you're finished, a brand new README.md file will appear with all your information in the distribution folder (./dist).

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
